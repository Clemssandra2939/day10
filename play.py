# Days in month
# Instructions

# In the starting code,you will find the solution from the leap year
# challenge.first convert the function is_leap() so that instead of printing 
# printing "leap year" or "Not leap year",it should return True if it is a leap year 
# and return False if it is not a leap year
# You are going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs EncodingWarning
# E.g day_in_month(year=2022,month= 2)

# And it will use this infomation to work out the number of days in the onth,then return that as the output 
E.g













# leap year coding char.
# how to know whether any year is a leap year
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# year=int(input("which year do u want to check?"))
# if year % 4:
#     print(f"{year} is a leap year")
# elif year % 100:
#     print(f"{year} is a not leap year")
   
# elif year % 400:
#     print(f"{year} is a leap year")

# else:
#     print(f"{year} is a not leap year")

# else:                                  
   #  print("f{year} is not a leap year")


# year=int(input("which year do u want to check? "))
# if year % 4==0:
#     if year % 100==0:

#         if year % 400==0:
#             print(f"{year} is leap year")
#         else: 
#             print(f"{year} is not leap year")
#     else:
#         print(f"{year} is leap year")

# else:
#     print(f"{year} is not leap year")
